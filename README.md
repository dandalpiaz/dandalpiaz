## Hi!

My name is **Dan Dalpiaz**. I am a _Web Application Developer_ at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu/) (UIUC) in the [University Library](https://www.library.illinois.edu/). I receieved a B.S. degree in Chemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology at UIUC and am a [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)](https://www.credly.com/badges/f9d01b2d-f567-4348-9491-2bbb3235b107/public_url).

## Web

Below are some personal web projects Iâ€™ve worked on over the years:

- **[bookmarks-startpage](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmarks-startpage/nkbcfcjndkpjejdfekeemdelppjdmlga)** â€“ browser extension that displays bookmarks on simple, customizable pages
  - A web app version, [demo.linking.page](https://demo.linking.page/), and [flask-linux-guide](https://github.com/dandalpiaz/flask-linux-guide) used
- **[markdown-pages.js](https://dandalpiaz.github.io/markdown-pages.js/)** â€“ simple Markdown-based static sites, without the generator
- **[drive-music-player](https://dandalpiaz.github.io/drive-music-player/)** â€“ browser-based music player for Google Drive (WIP)
